1) a. Embedded systems needs a setup to hold instructions for initialization (such as setting LED_BUILTIN to an output rather than input) and other things that need to be declared or defined before being used in the actual code. They need a loop to contain what we want to be done and because we typically want our device to run continuously while its power is on. Without the loop, everything will just be run once and our device will not do anything afterwards.
   b. Our code needs to be compiled so that the compiler can check for errors in our code that the compiler and machine will not understand as well as translate the code we write in a higher level langage to assembly and then machine code. 
   c.
